[![Tests](https://github.com/tonyroberts/pdf2array/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/tonyroberts/pdf2array/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

pdf2array is a Typescript package that loads PDF files and extracts text as a tabular array of values.

It uses [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) and is intended to make extracting tabular data from PDF files simpler.

For example usage see the [online demo](https://tonyroberts.github.io/pdf2array/).
